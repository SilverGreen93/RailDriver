# RailDriver software

This directory contains the sample application written by PI Engineering to demonstrate the communication between Train Simulator Classic with RailDriver.dll in 3rd party software.

The project was updated to build with Visual Studio 2022.

To run the project you need to have Train Simulator Classic installed. It is compatible only with the 32-bit version of the game.

To be able to use it with the 64-bit version you need to compile the project as 64-bit application and change the DllImport name to RailDriver64.dll.
